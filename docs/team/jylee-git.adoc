== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: implemented *user account and commands.*
** What it does: This allows all users to have a unique account to login and perform functions that are essential for
 work purpose.
** Justification: This feature is a core component of the product as certain functions (such as leave application),
require user authentication.
** Highlights: This enhancement is challenging as we need to modify a major portion of existing source codes and test
 codes, owing to the fact that the newly added NRIC parameter is unique and other existing fields, which are initially
 unique, are now not.

 * *Major enhancement 2*: implemented *priority level and commands.*
 ** What it does: All user accounts will have a priority level, which will allow/restrict them to functions that
 require an elevated user to do so.
 ** Justification: This feature is also a core component and complements the implementation of user accounts, as some
  features (e.g.: Approving of leaves), require someone of a senior rank to do so. This will prevent users from
  potentially abusing company resources and product functions.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
